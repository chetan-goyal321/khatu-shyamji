<main>
<p class="first">Shri Khatu Shyam Ji is a famous town in Sikar district of Rajasthan state of India, where there is a world famous temple of Baba Shyam. This temple is about 1000 years old, which was rebuilt by Abhay Singh ji in 1720 [2]. While the torso of Barbarik is worshiped in a small village of Syahadwa in Hisar district of Haryana.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="second">
    According to Hindu religion, Khatu Shyam ji had obtained a boon from Shri Krishna in Dwaparayuga that he would be worshiped by his name Shyam in Kaliyuga. Shri Krishna was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbarik and gave a boon that as Kaliyuga descends, you will be worshiped in the name of Shyam. Your devotees will be saved only by uttering your name with a true heart. If they worship you with true heart and love, then all their wishes will be fulfilled and all their works will be successful.

The unique story of Shri Shyam Baba begins from the medieval Mahabharata. He was earlier known as Barbarik. He is the grandson of extremely powerful mace bearer Bhima and mother Ahilavati. He was very brave and a great warrior since childhood. He learned the art of war from his mother and Shri Krishna. Pleased Mahadev by doing severe penance and got three unfailing arrows; Thus got the famous name of three arrows. Durga was pleased and presented him with a bow, which was capable of making him victorious in all the three worlds.

<p>The war of Mahabharata had become inevitable between Kauravas and Pandavas, when Barbarik received this news, his desire to participate in the war also awakened. When he reached to receive blessings from his mother, he promised his mother to support the losing side. He rode on his blue horse and went towards the battlefield of Kurukshetra with three arrows and a bow.
</p>
<p>The omnipresent Shri Krishna disguised as a Brahmin stopped him to know the secret of Barbarik and laughed at his words that he had come to participate in the war with only three arrows; Hearing this, Barbarik replied that only one arrow is enough to defeat the enemy army and after doing so the arrow will come back to Tunir. If all the three arrows are used, then the whole universe will be destroyed. Knowing this, Lord Krishna challenged him to pierce all the leaves of this tree. Both of them were standing under the Peepal tree. Barbarik accepted the challenge and took out an arrow from his tunir and remembered God and directed the arrow towards the leaves of the tree. The arrow pierced all the leaves of the tree in a moment and started circling around the feet of Shri Krishna, because he had hidden a leaf under his feet; Barbarik said that you remove your leg otherwise this arrow will pierce your leg as well. Thereafter, Shri Krishna asked the child Barbarik from which side he would participate in the war; Barbarik repeated the promise given to his mother and said that he will support the side which is weak and losing in the war. Shri Krishna knew that defeat in the war was certain for the Kauravas and therefore if Barbarik supported them, the result would go in the wrong direction.
</p>
<p>Therefore, Shri Krishna in the form of a Brahmin expressed his desire for charity from Veer Barbarik. Barbarik promised him and asked him to ask for charity. The Brahmin asked him for the donation of his head. Brave Barbarik was surprised for a moment, but remained firm on his word. Veer Barbarik said that an ordinary Brahmin cannot ask for such a donation, so he requested the Brahmin to inform about his real form. Shri Krishna in the form of Brahmin came in his real form. Shri Krishna explained to Barbarik the reason for asking for head donation that before the start of the war, the head of the best Kshatriya in all the three worlds has to be sacrificed for worshiping the battlefield; So they were forced to do so. Barbarik prayed to him that he wanted to see the war till the end. Shri Krishna accepted his prayer. Shri Krishna was pleased with this sacrifice and decorated Barbarik with the title of the best hero in the war. His head was decorated on a hill near the battlefield; From where Barbarik could take stock of the entire war. He had donated his head on the Dwadashi of Falgun month, thus he was called the donor of the head.
</p>
<p>At the end of the Mahabharata war, there was a mutual dispute among the Pandavas as to who gets the credit for the victory in the war. Shri Krishna told him that Barbarik's head is the witness of the entire war, so who can be a better judge than him? Everyone agreed with this and went towards the hill, after reaching there, Barbarik's head replied that Shri Krishna is the greatest character in getting victory in the war, his education, presence, war strategy was decisive. He could only see his Sudarshan Chakra spinning in the battlefield which was cutting the enemy army. Mahakali, on the orders of Krishna, was consuming the cups filled with the blood of the enemy army.</p>

Shri Krishna was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Veer Barbarik and gave a boon that in Kaliyuga you will be known by the name Shyam, because in that era only the one who supports the loser is able to bear the name Shyam.
<p>
    His head was buried in Khatu Nagar (present-day Sikar district of Rajasthan state) hence he is called Khatu Shyam Baba. A cow coming to that place was automatically flowing milk from her breasts every day. Later after digging that sheesh appeared, which was handed over to a Brahmin for a few days. Once the king of Khatu Nagar was inspired in a dream to build a temple and to decorate that head in the temple. Later, a temple was built at that place and the Ekadashi of the month of Kartik was decorated in the Sheesh temple, which is celebrated as such. The original temple was built in 1027 AD by Rup Singh Chauhan and his wife Narmada Kanwar. Abhay Singh, Diwan of Thakur, the ruler of Marwar, renovated the temple in 1720 AD on the instructions of Thakur. The temple took its present shape at this time and the idol was enshrined in the sanctum sanctorum. The idol is made of rare stone. Khatushyam is the totem of a large number of families.</p>

<h5>How did Barbarik become Khatushyam ji?</h5>
<p>His story begins with the medieval Mahabharata. Khatushyam ji was earlier known as Barbarik. Khatu Shyam ji was very strong and brave from childhood, he learned the art of war from his mother Morvi and Lord Krishna. He worshiped Lord Shiva and received three arrows from him. In this way he came to be known as the bearer of three arrows and Durga being pleased gave him a bow which could give him victory in all the three worlds. He also wanted to fight.</p>
    <p>He went to his mother and said, I also want to fight the war of Mahabharata, then his mother said, Son, on whose side will you fight? Then he said, I will fight on the side of the loser. When he was going to fight, he met Shri Krishna on the way and mocked him and said, "O child, this is not a playground, it is a war ground, even soldiers will not die in a war with three arrows." Arrows are not any ordinary arrows, my adorable Lord Shiva has given me these three infallible arrows, with these I will end the war in a moment." Shri Krishna in the form of Brahmin tested Barbarik and he tried to pierce the leaves of a Peepal tree. Said to. Barbarik pierced the leaves of the entire tree with a single arrow. Due to which Shri Krishna asked him for his head as a gift. Barbarik understood that he was not an ordinary Brahmin. After that Barbarik made the Brahmin appear in his real form. Said to. Seeing his Guru Shri Krishna in front of him, Barbarik asked him "Why did you do this Gurudev". After that Shri Krishna said that "O Barbarik, today I wanted Guru Dakshina from you, that's why I did all this." Barbarik said that " Oh Gurudev, you can take my head, but I want to see the entire Mahabharata war." Shri Krishna watered the head of brave Barbarik with nectar and made him immortal like Rahu's head. Barbarik's head was placed on the top of a high hill from where he could see the entire battle.</p> After the battle was over, the Pandavas became proud of their victory. To break his pride, Shri Krishna asked Barbarik, then Barbarik's head said that "Sudarshan Chakra of Gurudev Shri Krishna has ended the sinners in the whole war." After that Shri Krishna asked Barbarik to ask for something, then Barbarik asked Shri Krishna for his dark complexion. Seeing this selfless sacrifice of Barbarik, Shri Krishna said, "My dark complexion becomes yours Barbarik, as well as all my sixteen arts will be included in your head, you will be worshiped in my Shyam name and you will be worshiped as my image by the devotees in your court." No power in the world will be able to defeat him again and his wishes will also be fulfilled.</p>

<h5>Mr. Morvinandan Khatushyam</h5>
<p>According to the Skanda Purana composed by Rishi Vedvyas, after winning the competition of Veer Ghatotkacha, the son of Mahabali Bhima and Hidimba, he was married to Kamkatankakata, the daughter of King Daityaraj Moor of Pragjyotishpur (present day Assam). Kamakatankakata is also known by the name "Morvi". Ghatotkach and Mata Morvi were blessed with three sons, gems. The eldest son was named Barbarik because his hair was like Babbar's lion. These are the same brave Barbarik whom today people are known by various names like Shri Shyam of Khatu, Dev of Kalyug, Shyam Sarkar, Teen Bandhari, Sheesh ke Dani, Khatu Naresh and many other names. The other two sons were named Anjanparva and Meghavarna. The eldest son of Ghatotkach, Barbarik Mahadev became an ardent devotee of Shiva Shankar.</p>



<p>After the birth of Barbarik, Mahabali Ghatotkach took him to Dwarka to Lord Shri Krishna and on seeing him, Shri Krishna said to Veer Barbarik - O son of Morvaya! As Ghatotkach is dear to me, in the same way you are also dear to me. After that Veer Barbarik asked Shri Krishna - O Gurudev! What is the best use of this life? On listening to this innocent question of Veer Barbarik, Shri Krishna said - O son, the best use of this life is by always supporting religion by being a friend of charity and weak. For which you will have to earn strength and powers. Therefore, you earn powers by worshiping Navdurga in Mahisagar area (secret area). At the behest of Shri Krishna, the child Barbarik bowed down to God. Shri Krishna decorated Veer Barbarik with the name "Suhriday" after seeing his simple heart.</p>

<p>After that Barbarik acquired all weapons, knowledge, worshiped Navdurga for 3 years in Mahisagar area and provided unlimited powers and also provided a divine bow, after that Barbarik did penance to Lord Shankar with the inspiration of his Guru Shri Krishna. Pleased with the penance of Barbarik, Lord Shiva gave him three arrows with which the three worlds could be conquered. Here he got the name "Chandil". Mahadev disappeared by instructing Veer Barbarik to complete the achievement of a Brahmin named Vijay, his supreme devotee in the same area. When Vijay Brahmin arrived, Veer Barbarik completed his yagya by burning Pingal, Repalendra, Duhdruha and nine crores of flesh-eating Palasi demons into ashes like fire. On completing the yagya of that Brahmin, the deities were very pleased with the brave Barbarik and appeared and gave the powers of the yagya in the form of ashes.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Barbarik turned down the marriage proposal of snake girls on the way between earth and underworld, saying that they have taken a vow to remain celibate for life.</p>

<p>When the Mahabharata war started, Veer Barbarik expressed his desire to participate in the war in front of his mother Morvi. Then the mother ordered them to participate in the war with the promise that you will support the losing side in the war. When Veer went to participate in the barbaric war, Lord Shri Krishna, before the Mahabharata war, because of the minor curse received by Brahma ji of his previous birth (Yaksharaj Suryavarcha) and thinking that if Veer would participate in the barbaric war, the Kauravas would end only. In 18 days the Mahabharata war cannot take place and the defeat of the Pandavas will be certain. Thinking like this, Shri Krishna deprived the brave Barbarik of the Mahabharata war by beheading him. As soon as he did this, a wave of mourning ran in the battlefield, instantly 14 goddesses appeared in the battlefield. The goddesses revealed the curse received by Brahma ji in the previous birth of Veer Barbarik (Yaksharaj Suryavarcha) in front of all the present warriors as follows-</p>

<p>The goddesses said: "Before the beginning of the Dwaparayuga, distressed by the atrocities of the Moor demon, the earth appeared in the assembly of gods in its cow form and said - "O Gods! I am able to bear all kinds of suffering. Mountains, rivers, streams and I happily bear the burden of the entire human race and conduct my daily activities well, but I am deeply saddened by the atrocities of the Moor monster. Please protect me from this miscreant, I have come to your shelter.

    Hearing the compassionate call of Gauswarupa Dhara, there was utter silence in the whole assembly. After a brief silence, Lord Brahma said - "Now the only way to get rid of this is that we all should take refuge in Lord Vishnu and pray to him to get rid of this crisis of the earth."
   
    That's why Yaksharaj Suryavarcha, sitting in the assembly of Gods, said in his ojasvi speech - "O Gods! The Moor demon is not so majestic, which only Vishnu ji can destroy. We should not trouble him for every thing. If you allow me, then Only I can kill him.</p>

<p>Then Krishna spoke the words of the cloud-deep-voiced Lord!
    As long as the earth is the star, as long as the moon and the sun!
    So far, my son of all the worlds! You will be worshipped!! (Skanda Purana, Kau. B. 66.73,74)
    Meaning: Then Lord Krishna, who spoke as gravely as a cloud, said, "O calf! As long as this is the earth, the stars and as long as the sun, the moon, you will be worshiped by all.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Lord Hari also said to Suryavarcha, the king of the Yakshas, as follows:


    तत्सतथेती तं प्राह केशवो देवसंसदि !
    शिरस्ते पूजयिषयन्ति देव्याः पूज्यो भविष्यसि !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.६५)
    
    
    Meaning: "At that time, in the assembly of the deities, Shri Hari said - O hero! Well, your head will be worshiped and you will be worshiped in the form of a god and you will get fame."
    
    After narrating this story to all the people present there, Goddess Chandika again said- "Seeing the culmination of his curse into a boon, Yaksharaj Suryavarcha disappeared from that assembly and in due course of time in this earth world, due to the contact of Mahabali Bhima's son Ghatotkach and Morvi, he became barbaric." took birth in. That's why all of you should not grieve over this and there is no fault of Shri Krishna in this.
    
    
    इत्युक्ते चण्डिका देवी तदा भक्त शिरस्तिव्दम !
    अभ्युक्ष्य सुधया शीघ्र मजरं चामरं व्याधात !!
    
    यथा राहू शिरस्त्द्वत तच्छिरः प्रणामम तान !
    उवाच च दिदृक्षामि तदनुमन्यताम !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७१,७२)
    Meaning: "Having said this, Chandika Devi quickly sprinkled the head of that devotee (Shri Veer Barbarik) with nectar and made it immortal and immortal like Rahu's head and this newly awakened head bowed down to them all and Said - "I want to see the war, you all approve it."</p>


<p>ततः कृष्णो वच: प्राह मेघगम्भीरवाक् प्रभु: !
    यावन्मही स नक्षत्र याव्च्चंद्रदिवाकरौ !
    तावत्वं सर्वलोकानां वत्स! पूज्यो भविष्यसि !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७३,७४)
    Meaning: After that, Lord Shri Krishna, who is as serious as a cloud, said - "O Vats! As long as this earth is a constellation and as long as the sun is the moon, you will be worshipable by all.
    </p>

<p>देवी लोकेषु सर्वेषु देवी वद विचरिष्यसि !
    स्वभक्तानां च लोकेषु देवीनां दास्यसे स्थितिम !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७५,७६)
    
    Meaning: "You will move like goddesses in the places of Saidav goddesses and will maintain the same dignity as all goddesses in the community of your devotees"
    </p>
<p>
    बालानां ये भविष्यन्ति वातपित्त क्फोद्बवा: !
    पिटकास्ता: सूखेनैव शमयिष्यसि पूजनात !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७७)
    Meaning: "You will easily cure the diseases of your child-like devotees who are suffering from Vata, Pitta and Kapha."</p>
<p>इदं च श्रृंग मारुह्य पश्य युद्धं यथा भवेत !
    इत्युक्ते वासुदेवन देव्योथाम्बरमा विशन !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७८)</p>
<p>
    Meaning: "And watch the battle take place by climbing on the top of this mountain, thus at the behest of Vasudev Shri Krishna, all the goddesses disappeared into the sky."</p>
<p>बर्बरीक शिरश्चैव गिरीश्रृंगमबाप तत् !
    देहस्य भूमि संस्काराश्चाभवशिरसो नहि !
    ततो युद्धं म्हाद्भुत कुरु पाण्डव सेनयो: !! (स्कन्द पुराण, कौ. ख. ६६.७९,८०)
    Meaning: "The head of brave Barbarik reached the top of the mountain and his torso was cremated according to the classical method but the head was not performed (because the head had transformed into a deity). After that there was fierce fighting in the Kaurava and Pandava army war broke out."
    </p>
<p>Yogeshwar Lord Shri Krishna irrigated the head of Veer Barbarik with nectar by 14 goddesses (Siddha, Ambika, Kapali, Tara, Bhaneshwari, Charchi, Ekbira, Bhutambika, Siddhi, Trepura, Chandi, Yogeshwari, Triloki, Jetra) who appeared in the battlefield. By getting that head made immortal by giving it divinity, Lord Shri Krishna gave the boon of Veer Barbarik's head being worshiped as a deity in Kaliyuga to fulfill the wishes of the devotees. Veer Barbarik expressed his strong desire to see the war of Mahabharata in front of Lord Shri Krishna, which Shri Krishna fulfilled by placing the godly head of Veer Barbarik on a high mountain and got his body cremated according to the scriptures...</p>
<p>
    At the end of the Mahabharata war, a debate broke out among the Pandavas as to to whom the credit for the victory in the war goes. Shri Krishna said that Barbarik's head should be asked whose bravery he had seen in this war. Then Veer Barbarik's head replied that this war was won only because of Lord Shri Krishna's policy and only Lord Shri Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra was running in this war. As soon as Veer Barbarik said this, the whole sky was illuminated and flowers started raining on the head of that deity and the deities blew their conch shells. After that, Lord Shri Krishna again bowed down to the head of Veer Barbarik and said - "O brave Barbarik, you will be worshiped everywhere in Kaliyuga and fulfill the desired work of all your devotees. Therefore, you should not leave this area, Please forgive those who have committed crimes.</p>
<p>On hearing this, a wave of joy ran in the Pandava army. The soldiers re-irrigated the head with the water of holy shrines and hoisted their victory flag near the head. On this day everyone celebrated the victory of Mahabharata with pomp.</p>
<p>The character of Veervar Morvinandan Shri Barbarik is given in detail in Skanda Purana's "second sub-section 'Kaumarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand". Sage Vedvyas ji has also praised him from this supernatural source in the 115th and 116th verses of the 66th chapter of "Maheshwar Khand's second sub-section Kaumarika Khand" in Skanda Purana.
</p>
<p>donor of glass
    When Shri Krishna asked him for his head, he offered his head to him without any hesitation and the devotees started calling him as the giver of heads. Shri Krishna wanted to make the Pandavas victorious in the war. Barbarik had already promised his mother to support the loser and before the war, the head of a brave man had to be presented for the battlefield worship, so Shri Krishna asked him for the donation of the head.</p>
<p>Lakhdatar
    It is the belief of the devotees that if any thing is asked from Baba, then Baba gives it lakhs of times, that is why he is also known as Lakhdatar.</p>
<p>loser's support
    As mentioned in this article, Baba had taken a vow to support the losing side, that is why Baba is also called the support of the loser.</p>
<p>Only because of the promise to fight on the side of the loser and the order received from grandmother Hidimba. Due to the problem arising in Lord Krishna's mind, the heads of Barbarik and Baba were asked by Lord Vasudev. Because one, the Kuru army could not be finished before eighteen days. And the other fact was that Mahabali Barbarik used to fight on behalf of the weak and defeated, so in the end no one except Mahabali Barbarik was left. Because on which side he used to fight, the other side would have become weak. Then as per his vow, he would have to fight on the side of the loser. Hence only Mahabali Barbarik would have survived in the end.
